## Overall Feedback for Deliverable #2

While the structure of the app is ok, I would recommend putting the `pokemon.csv` file in `src/main/resources` folder. Currently, there is no value for `artifactId` and `groupId`, please specify that. The project __seems__ functional as of commit #b5fe5e. All methods are missing JavaDocs. Ensure additional features of the project (apart from classification) are added in Menu.java for the next deliverable. You parse 53 fields from your CSV file so you have plenty of opportunity to implement features there.
