**Group 3 Project Proposal: Pokemon Classification**

	Our team plans to implement the Classification NLP problem using a dataset of 6991 Gen 1 Pokemon images we found through the Hugging Face dataset website given to us through GitHub.[^1] The reason we chose to use Pokemon is because we thought it would be easier to make a program that is able to classify Pokemon based on an image and create a label for said Pokemon, rather than having to put vague descriptions of the Pokemon into Google or another search engine to figure out what Pokemon it is. For the sake of our mental health we chose to only focus on Gen 1 Pokemon, as doing every pokemon ever may have been a bit too much for a single project. Also, it just seemed like a fun domain to focus on for this project.   
The primary objective of our application is to take a user inputted image of any Gen 1 Pokemon and the program should be able to accurately figure out which Pokemon it is using a dataset of all 151 gen 1 Pokemon, and then tell the user what Pokemon it is. Below is a very rough draft of what our project will look like in the form of a UML Diagram:
